            <p class="apresentacao_conteudo_texto">I bring with me a unique perspective, having previously worked in architecture, which has enriched my potential in the IT sector. My background has taught me the importance of good communication skills, both written and spoken, as well as leadership, which I learned through my experience as a professor in a faculty inspiring my students.</p>
            <p class="apresentacao_conteudo_texto">I pride myself on being versatile, constantly learning and adapting to new challenges. I have learned in practice how to be a quick learner, and how to overcome obstacles that come my way. Challenges, to me, are opportunities for growth and evolution.</p>
